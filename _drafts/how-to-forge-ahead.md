How to forge ahead when you don’t where you’re going

After I graduated from university in 2008, without a clear sense of what I wanted to do besides move to the UK, a friend recommended I read What Colour is Your Parachute.

It’s a helpful book, if a bit painfully cheerful and optimistic as only Americans can be. One of the things I found most helpful was the general ‘map’ it provided for forging ahead when you don’t know where you’re going.

The book encourages readers to identify their transferable skills, where they would like to use these skills (interests, fields, occupations, careers, organisations), and then advice on reaching out to professionals to hear about the work they’re doing.

So that’s what I’ve done.

## Transferable skills

I will absolutely not enumerate any skills here, the risk of self-deprecating humour is too great nor do I feel it’s appropriate. People can peruse LinkedIn for this information.

## Where to use them

That has been the million dollar question lately. Everything I’ve trained for or envisioned as a future has been associated with academia. It’s hard to imagine what I don’t know exists.

I’ve decided I’d like to use my experience in writing and critical thinking, ideally for something I believe in. Shocking, I know. Impossible? Probably. Maybe I’m too cynical or materialistic, I don’t know.

I’d like to work collaboratively. I miss having a team of co-workers. Being busy everyday is also important to me and it would be grand if the work was intellectually stimulating and engaging.

Writing, communicating, thinking will be a part of my work. Teaching as well, if possible.

Throwing a wide net.

## Reaching out

This has been by far the most informative and enjoyable experience. Strangers have been generous with their time and patient with my questions. I hope one day I can do the same for someone else. 

I’ve reached out to professionals in the non-profit, think tank, research and communications sectors. They’ve provided helpful advice, direction, and support. It’s confirmed my faith in humanity.

Unsurprisingly, most have advised to stay away from non-profits, gain experience in the private sector, and return to what you love only after you’ve sold your soul for some time. I’m loosely paraphrasing.

Faith in humanity slightly less confirmed.

The work continues.
