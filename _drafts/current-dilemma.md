title:  "Introducing: current dilemma"

The current dilemma I’m facing is whether to begin this business of writing at all. Evidently I’ve made a decision. <!-- more -->

### Background

I’m an American masters student in Manchester studying the history of gender in higher education, specifically computer science, in twentieth century Britain. I began my academic path by studying constructions of femininity at British women’s colleges in the long nineteenth century.

My current work examines the construction of masculinity, class, and professionalism in the emerging field of computer science in 1950s/60s Manchester. I’m interested in how men connected manliness and technology to construct a specifically gendered and classed profession of ‘computer scientist’.

### Why write?

To practice. For relief. Because it seems both sensible and nonsensical. Despite the madness of a dissertation, and perhaps my better judgement, I’ve decided that writing in my spare time will be relaxing.

The blog format feels both natural and a bit, well, vulgar. I cannot believe the musings of yet another broke student will add much excitement or nuance to the internet void. It seems presumptuous to pour thoughts on to paper like some self-obsessed teenager.

Yet here I am, writing this now. I’m committed, there’s no turning back.

### What to write?

At this point it will be whatever comes to mind. It may end up being general thoughts on gender history, complaints about the study of history or academia more generally, and most likely current dilemmas I’m facing.

### What’s next?

Dinner.
