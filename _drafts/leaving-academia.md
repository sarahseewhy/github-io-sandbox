And thanks for all the fish.

Just kidding.

I’ve made the decision to leave academia, to leave history. <!-- more --> I’ve declined to do a PhD and am trailblazing to who knows where.

This is terrifying.

I’ve wanted to be a history professor since the first semester of my sophomore year when I led my first seminar and gave a lecture. It was one of the most exhilarating feelings I’ve ever had – it felt like flying or soaring. The ability to command the material, guide a discussion, debate with my peers, everything about the experience resonated.

Finishing my first dissertation as an undergraduate was another revelatory moment: I knew I wanted to do this all over again and again. I loved the research, the writing, the editing – everything about doing history surrounded by other historians.

So why leave? Well, here goes:

### Why I’m leaving #1
Logistics, plain and simple. I’m sure there’s a word for this in Marxism (materialist something?). The job market for history PhDs is dismal and provides limited financial stability. Perhaps this is too honest but I have bills to pay. I need to make a living, and not just now but in the future.

I also want to make my life in the UK with my British partner. This is my home now and I want it to be home for a long, long time.

### Why I’m leaving #2
The dissertation proposal. I’m not kidding. Don’t get me wrong, it’s a fascinating topic and I worked hard on developing and researching it. It’s just not the project for me to do.

Most of the historical literature on the fight for women’s higher education focuses on Britain and America (arguably so, but we’ll leave that be). There are very few (read: none) that examine the movement as an international movement, one which was connected across continents and potentially coordinated. There are national studies of women’s higher education for various countries but from what I can tell no definitive study connection the movements together.

In my research on women’s higher education in Britain I came across a number of references in the archives to alumni who went on to foster women’s education internationally. I proposed examining in particular the connections between women’s higher education in Britain and America with Japan, Korea, and China.

While this is an interesting project it’s a tad grandiose, ambitious. I don’t have the language skills in Mandarin, Korean, or Japanese to do this project justice.

And to be honest, I don’t think I’m passionate enough about it.

### Why I’m leaving #3
As much as I love doing history – research, writing, thinking – it can get lonely. It’s no particularly collaborative. Teaching? Love it. Working with other historians? Wouldn’t give it up.

But sitting for hours by myself, day after day, it’s wearying.

I’d like to find work where I can collaborate more, where I feel like I’m building something tangible.


What’s next?

I have no idea. Isn’t that terrifying?
