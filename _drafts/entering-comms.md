Entering...communications?

I have a job. Well, internship. I’m starting an experiment in communications (public relations). 

## Why comms

Of all the people I interviewed about their work, I was most impressed by the women and men in communications – especially those who worked for non-profits. 

It seems like the profession matches most of the criteria I had for what I want to do. I can also start in the private sector and use my experience to eventually transfer to an organisation closer to my interests and values. 

I will be writing (hopefully, it is internship after all), reading new material, and working with a team of colleagues.

The work sounds challenging, it’s in finance which I’m less familiar with than 19th and 20th century gender history or feminist theory.

## What I hope to achieve

Learn whether I enjoy this. Is this a career I could have for six months, a year, ten years?
Have a salary. I’ve mentioned this before, but there are bills that need paying.
Learn what it’s like compromise a desire for activism with the need to make a living.

Besides that I’m trying to keep an open mind. This is not the future I envisioned for myself. There’s a line from The Impossible Will Take Awhile that springs to mind: “How to be a happy warrior in an institution with nowhere near the required sense of urgency?” I think that’s the question I need to find an answer to.

## What’s next

I move to London, find a flat in city I’ve not lived in since I was six years old, starting making a life.
