A profound question – made deceptively simple on the command line:

```bash
$ whoami
```

The algorithmic reduction of a deeply philosophical question to a single, reliable answer is both comforting and disturbing.

The multiplicity and inter-play of identities gone in a flash of ones and zeros.

In its place a confident assertion of self:

```bash
$ whoami
$ sarah
```

On days when I need reminding, I will sometimes run this command just to provide an extra sense of self, just for the fun of it – philosophy and social constructionist theory be-damned.
### Effective user id

The `whoami` command:

> writes the user name (i.e., login name) of the owner of the current login session to standard output.

The command essentially asks the operating system to identify the user running the command `whoami`. The answer changes if and when I switch to a different user, and defaults to the user who has opened the shell session.

I sometimes wonder what my effective user id would be in the world of people. If I asked colleagues `whoami` what would they say?

Most obviously they would return my name. Perhaps after that they would respond with my profession (software developer), then maybe my current sub-field (infrastructure).

So simple, so reliable.

No particularly satisfying.

### Identity and whoami

When I studied history one of the big questions discussed was identity or identities. How to define identity? How to quantify or qualify it/them? How to study it/them?

In the field of gender history, (gender) identities were acknowledged as mutable, changing over time, place, context, and individual.

Part of the joy of studying femininities or masculinities was finding those moments of disruption when change appeared more evident.

The infinite complexity was what drew me to the subject, the lack of reliability.

I think this is why I find the `whoami` command so entertaining – it’s so blissfully and wilfully obtuse to the plurality of identities.

And yet...
It’s both entertaining and disturbing.

I sometimes worry about a field of professionals who are accustomed to answers that are so reliable, so simple, so binary.

If they aren’t forced to answer questions of self, of identity, but instead rely on the logic of `whoami` what does that teach them of their peers who answer that question – who am I – with a plurality?
